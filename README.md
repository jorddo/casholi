## Description ðŸŒŒ

Casholi is an e-commerce backend that uses Sequelize to manipulate a MySQL database. The project uses an Express.js API.

When working on this project I learned a lot about using Insomnia to test API routes. I also learned more about the way Sequelize functions, as I spent a good chunk of time in the docs.
